## About Phoenix

[Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) is a web development framework to build rich, interactive web applications, with components and concepts likened to Ruby on Rails or Python's Django. It provides high developer productivity and high application performance. It allows you to create real-time features with server-rendered HTML delivered over websocket, and HTML-aware compile time checking.

## Develop locally ðŸš€

You need to have [a local PostgreSQL database](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#postgresql) [configured and running](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/mix_tasks.html#mix-ecto-create).

Set up your local development environment by following these steps:

1. Configure your local PostgreSQL database in `/config/dev.exs`
2. Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

The live development website should be available at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
